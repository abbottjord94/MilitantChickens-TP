This is a group project to create a custom messaging protocol to send files across a TCP connection, made for CS 346 (Telecommunications). It implements the protocol described below, and includes a client and server program. Beyond these initial requirements, this implementation can also send a file of any size and can encrypt the network stream via a randomly-generated key, exchanged via the Diffie-Hellman method.

## Protocol Description:

The protocol is a simple request/response-based framework, with some inspiration taken from HTTP. 

### Getting Files:

To request a file, a client send a header with the following format:

Request Type | File Path
-------------|----------
GET          |(path)    

NOTE: The client must send the total length of the header prior to actually sending the header itself.

The server will then send a response with the following format:

Response Code | File Data
--------------|----------
1 (OK)        | (data)

NOTE: The server must send the total length of the header prior to actually sending the header itself.

If an error occurs, this type of header should be sent:

Response Code | Description
--------------|----------
2 (Error)     | (description)

### Sending Files:

To send a file, a client send a header with the following format:

Request Type | File Path | Data
-------------|-----------|-----
POST         |(path)     | (data)

NOTE: The client must send the total length of the header prior to actually sending the header itself.

The server will then send a response with the following format:

Response Code | Description
--------------|----------
1 (OK)        | (description)

NOTE: The server must send the total length of the header prior to actually sending the header itself.

If an error occurs, this type of header should be sent:

Response Code | Description
--------------|----------
2 (Error)     | (description)
